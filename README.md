**Aqua_Flow_Analysis_Platform_project**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

üìå**Overview**

The **Aqua-Flow Analytics Platform** is an AI-powered solution designed to monitor drainage and sewage systems in real-time. By using a network of IoT sensors and cameras, the platform enables **early detection** of issues such as blockages, overflows, and leaks, allowing for **prompt intervention**.  
Our goal is to improve **public health and safety**, particularly in low-income communities, by preventing sewage-related hazards through proactive monitoring and predictive maintenance.

üöÄ **Features**

- **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  Continuous data collection from sensors and cameras to track sewage and drainage system conditions.

- **Early Defect Detection**  
  AI models detect anomalies such as blockages, leaks, and unusual flow rates.

- **Predictive Analytics**  
  Forecasts potential failures using historical and live data trends.

- **Automated Alerts**  
  Instant notifications sent to maintenance teams upon detecting critical conditions.

- **Data Dashboard**  
  Intuitive visualization of pipeline health, flow rates, and detected issues.

üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack**

- **Hardware**: IoT Sensors
- **Backend**: Python
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow 
- **Database**: Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3
- **Messaging & Alerts**: Email

‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**

1. **Data Collection**  
   IoT sensors measure flow rate, pressure, and detect unusual patterns. Cameras capture visual feeds for image analysis.

2. **Data Processing**  
   Raw sensor and image data are transmitted to the cloud for preprocessing.

3. **AI Detection**  
   AI models analyze the data to detect blockages, cracks, leaks, or overflow risks.

4. **Alerts & Reports**  
   Maintenance teams receive automated alerts and can view detailed analytics via the dashboard.
